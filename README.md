My name is Mohammad Javad ðŸ˜ƒ. I started programming when I was 15. Now, I'm co-founder and software engineer at [Quera](https://quera.ir), a technology company that aims to create a community of developers, educate them, and help them find the perfect job. I live in Tehran, Iran. I love contributing to open source projects.
