Hi! ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Mohammad Javad. I started programming when I was 15. Now, I'm co-founder and CTO at [Quera](https://quera.org), a technology company that aims to create a community of developers, educate them, and help them find the perfect job. I live in Tehran, Iran. I love contributing to open source projects.
